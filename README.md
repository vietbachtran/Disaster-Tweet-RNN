# Disaster Tweet Detection with RNN

The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from the Kaggle competition titled "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets" (available at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview). This competition focuses on a binary classification task where the objective is to determine whether a given tweet pertains to a real disaster event or not.

The nature of this classification problem is inherently binary: each tweet is categorized as either relevant to a disaster (label 1) or irrelevant to any disaster (label 0). This distinction is crucial for developing systems that can effectively identify and classify disaster-related content in social media, which can have significant implications for emergency response and public awareness.

For this project, the primary goal is to construct and train a deep learning model, specifically utilizing recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to predict the likelihood that a tweet is related to a disaster. RNNs are particularly well-suited for this task due to their ability to process sequential data and capture contextual dependencies in text.

The training dataset comprises a collection of tweets along with their associated labels. Each entry in the dataset consists of a snippet of text from a tweet and a corresponding label indicating whether the tweet discusses a disaster (label 1) or not (label 0). This labeled data is used to train the model, enabling it to learn patterns and features that differentiate disaster-related tweets from non-disaster ones.

In summary, the project aims to leverage deep learning techniques to enhance the accuracy of disaster detection in tweets, ultimately contributing to more effective management and response to disaster situations through automated social media monitoring.
